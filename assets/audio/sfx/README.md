## Sound Effects

This directory will contain sound effects for the game.

Default placeholder sounds would include:
- Oscillator sounds (various pitches)
- Percussion sounds (kick, snare, hi-hat)
- UI feedback sounds

These will be referenced by NPCs in the game.

For now, actual audio files need to be added manually.
